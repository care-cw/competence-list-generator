# competence-list-generator

This is a lean, mean generator-machine! To accomplish fast and easy competence list creations.

Just transcribe the competence list form into the given structure of example.data.json, 
change the reference in scripts.js and
run it by typing http-server (maybe you need to install it first: npm install -g http-server

ENJOY!
