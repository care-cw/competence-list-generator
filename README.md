# competence-list-generator

This is a lean, mean generator-machine! To accomplish fast and easy competence list creations.

1. Just transcribe the competence list form into the given structure of example.data.json, 

2. change the reference in scripts.js and

3. run it by typing http-server in the terminal (maybe you need to install it first: npm install -g http-server)

ENJOY!
